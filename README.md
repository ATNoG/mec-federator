# MEC Federator

This MEC Federator was developed in accordance with ETSI and GSMA-related specifications. It was built to work with the ATNoG OSM-MEC platform, communicating with our MEC Orchestrator, enhancing it with federation capabilities.

## Evaluation

The federation capabilities of this component, in coordination with the ATNoG OSM-MEC, were evaluated using the test application available at https://github.com/ATNoG/mec-test-app. This repository also stores the performed tests and their results.
